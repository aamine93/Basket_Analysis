# Market Basket Analysis

This repository contains a Market Basket Analysis project using Python and Jupyter Notebook to identify product associations in grocery shopping data. The project uses the **Apriori algorithm** to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules. It includes visualizations and a business-focused analysis in an HTML report.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights for:
- Product bundling
- Cross-selling recommendations
- Store layout optimization
- Data-driven promotional strategies

By applying association rule mining, we identify meaningful product combinations that appear frequently in customer baskets, helping retailers improve sales and the overall shopping experience.

## Features

- Data preparation and basket matrix transformation
- Association rule mining using:
  - **Support** (frequency of a rule)
  - **Confidence** (likelihood of purchase)
  - **Lift** (strength of association compared to chance)
- Filtering rules for actionable insights
- Visualizations:
  - Support vs Confidence scatter plot
  - Lift vs Confidence scatter plot
  - Top 10 rules bar chart
  - Network graph of product associations
- Exported HTML report for easy sharing
- Jupyter Notebook for code exploration and reproducibility
